# Diffie-Hellman key exchange alghorithm with AES and SHA256

This code was created for demonstrating the principle of Diffie-Hellman key exchange alghorithm alongisde with encrypting the key with AES and SHA256.

*REMAINDER: This code serves education purposes only. It should be not used as a silution for encryption of highly exposed security demanding applications!*

For understanding basics of this alghorithm, I recommend this great [Medium article](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/learning-cryptography-diffie-hellman-key-exchange-discrete-log-problem-cyclic-groups-28703f3d5a48)
