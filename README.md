# Diffie-Hellman key exchange alghorithm with AES and SHA256

This code was created for demonstrating the principle of Diffie-Hellman key exchange alghorithm alongisde with encrypting the key with AES and SHA256.

*REMAINDER: This code serves education purposes only. It should be not used as a silution for encryption of highly exposed security demanding applications!*
